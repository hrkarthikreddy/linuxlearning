# Chapter 4: Moving Around the Filesystem

## Overview

This chapter explores the foundational elements of the Linux filesystem, its directory structure, and the tools used to navigate it. Mastery of navigation commands, path referencing, hidden files, and related shortcuts provides essential skills for system management.


## Understanding the Filesystem Tree

The Linux filesystem adheres to the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) and follows a tree structure starting from the root `/` directory. Everything in Linux is a file or directory, and all paths originate from this root.

### Top-Level Directories:

| Directory        | Description                                                           |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/`              | Root of the entire filesystem                                         |
| `/bin`           | Essential command binaries for users (e.g., `ls`, `cp`)               |
| `/sbin`          | Essential system binaries for administration (e.g., `reboot`, `fsck`) |
| `/boot`          | Static files for booting, including the Linux kernel                  |
| `/dev`           | Device files (e.g., `/dev/sda1` for disk partitions)                  |
| `/etc`           | System-wide configuration files                                       |
| `/home`          | User directories (e.g., `/home/alice`)                                |
| `/lib`, `/lib64` | Shared libraries used by binaries in `/bin` and `/sbin`               |
| `/media`, `/mnt` | Mount points for removable and temporary media                        |
| `/opt`           | Add-on software packages                                              |
| `/proc`          | Virtual filesystem providing process and kernel information           |
| `/root`          | Home directory for the root user                                      |
| `/run`           | Runtime data like process IDs and sockets                             |
| `/srv`           | Data for services (e.g., web, FTP)                                    |
| `/sys`           | Interface to kernel components                                        |
| `/tmp`           | Temporary files (cleared at reboot)                                   |
| `/usr`           | Secondary hierarchy for read-only data                                |
| `/var`           | Variable data like logs, mail, and spool files                        |

### Visual Hierarchy:

```
/
├── bin
├── boot
├── dev
├── etc
├── home
│   ├── user1
│   └── user2
├── lib
├── media
├── mnt
├── opt
├── proc
├── root
├── run
├── sbin
├── srv
├── sys
├── tmp
├── usr
└── var
```

## Using the `cd` Command

`cd` (change directory) is the command-line tool for navigating between directories.

### Syntax:

```bash
cd [path]
```

### Path Variants:

- **Absolute path**: Starts with `/`, e.g., `cd /etc`
- **Relative path**: Relative to current directory, e.g., `cd ../docs`

### Common Usage:

```bash
cd /var/log         # Absolute
cd ..               # Move one level up
cd ../../           # Move two levels up
cd ~                # Go to home directory
cd -                # Return to previous directory
```

Tab-completion (`Tab` key) can auto-complete directory and file names.

---

## Absolute vs Relative Paths

### Absolute Path:

- Starts from root (`/`)
- Full, non-ambiguous reference

```bash
cd /home/user1/documents
```

### Relative Path:

- Starts from current location
- More efficient in interactive use

```bash
cd ../scripts
```

---

## Listing Directory Contents with `ls`

Displays files and folders in the specified directory.

### Syntax:

```bash
ls [options] [directory]
```

### Useful Flags:

- `-l`: Long listing format
- `-a`: Show hidden files
- `-h`: Human-readable sizes
- `-R`: Recursively list subdirectories
- `-F`: Classify entries (adds `/`, `*`, `@`)

### Examples:

```bash
ls -lh /etc
ls -a ~
ls -R /usr/local
```

---

## Using `pwd` (Print Working Directory)

Prints the absolute path of the current directory.

### Example:

```bash
$ pwd
/home/user1/projects
```

Always confirm your location before running scripts or file operations.

---

## Hidden Files and Directories

Files and folders starting with a dot (`.`) are hidden from normal view.

### Examples:

```bash
ls -a           # Reveals .bashrc, .profile, .gitconfig
cd ~/.config    # Access hidden configuration directory
```

---

## Navigational Shortcuts

Linux shell supports abbreviations to simplify path traversal:

| Symbol | Description        |
| ------ | ------------------ |
| `.`    | Current directory  |
| `..`   | Parent directory   |
| `~`    | Home directory     |
| `-`    | Previous directory |

### Example Commands:

```bash
cd ..         # Go up one level
cd ~          # Home directory
cd -          # Previous directory
```

---

## Advanced Techniques

### Tab Completion

Use `Tab` key after typing part of a command or filename to autocomplete or list possibilities.

### Combining Commands:

```bash
cd /var && ls -lh   # Change and list contents
```

---

## Practice Examples

### Navigate to a Configuration Directory:

```bash
cd /etc/network
tree
```

### Traverse Nested Folders:

```bash
cd ~/projects/python/scripts
cd ../../../docs
```

### View Hidden Files in Home Directory:

```bash
cd ~
ls -la
```

By internalizing filesystem structures and mastering navigation commands, Linux users become efficient administrators capable of confidently managing file systems in scripts, servers, and development environments.

Practice often using a real shell, and use `pwd`, `ls -lah`, and tab-completion frequently to enhance speed and accuracy.
